.SYNOPSIS 
Waits customization process for list virtual machines to completes.

.DESCRIPTION 
Waits customization process for list virtual machines to completes. 
The script returns if customization process ends for all virtual machines or if the specified timeout elapses. 
The script returns PSObject for each specified VM. 
The output object has VM and CustomizationStatus properties.


.NOTES 
The script is based on sveral vCenter events. 
* VmStarting event - this event is posted on power on operation 
* CustomizationStartedEvent event - this event is posted for VM when customiztion has started 
* CustomizationSucceeded event - this event is posted for VM when customization has successfully completed 
* CustomizationFailed - this event is posted for VM when customization has failed

Possible CustomizationStatus values are: 
* "VmNotStarted" - if it was not found VmStarting event for specific VM. 
* "CustomizationNotStarted" - if it was not found CustomizationStarterdEvent for specific VM. 
* "CustomizationStarted" - CustomizationStartedEvent was found, but Succeeded or Failed event were not found 
* "CustomizationSucceeded" - CustomizationSucceeded event was found for this VM 
* "CustomizationFailed" - CustomizationFailed event wass found for this VM
